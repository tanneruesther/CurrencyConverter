## Why I Created This Project
I created this project to further my learning in web development by building a real-world application. The main goal was to:

Understand how to interact with an external API and fetch real-time currency data.
Learn how to manipulate DOM elements dynamically based on user input.
Improve my knowledge of JavaScript, specifically with asynchronous programming using fetch and async/await.
Build a responsive, user-friendly application that can be used to perform currency conversions easily.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in API integration, handling user input, and working with dynamic content on a webpage.
